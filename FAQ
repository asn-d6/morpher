Question 1:
- What kind of weird file format does morpher.py expect for its
  probability distributions?

- morpher.py file format:

  * Comments are lines that *start* with '#'.
  * All non-comment lines must be of the form: "<length in bytes>: <probability>"
  * Non-comment lines must be listed with an increasing <length in bytes>
    field.
  
  For example:
  
  """
  # Example prob. distr. file
  # Another comment
  1: 0.35
  2: 0.22
  3: 0.43
  """
  
  represents a probability distributions of a protoocol whose packets
  are only 1, 2 or 3 bytes in size.
  
Question 2:
- What kind of weird file format does dream.py expect for its
  morphing matrices?

- dream.py expects its morphing matrices in Matrix Market format [0].

  Ideally, morphing matrices should be given in Matrix Market Coordinate
  Format since morphing matrices are sparse.
  
  [0]: scipy.io.mmread() is used to load up the matrices. 
  
Question 3:
- Why are you spawning glpsol(1) instances to solve LP problems instead
  of simply using a Python wrapper of GLPK like PyGLPK or PyMathProg?
  What kind of a freak are you?

- I coded a solver using PyMathProg [0] but the resulting morphing
  matrix was buggy; it contained large negative values in some cases.
  I spent lots of time to find the issue but after a while I gave up and
  decided to use glpsol which always served me well.
  
  If you can make a morphing matrix solver using PyGLPK or PyMathProg,
  patches are more than welcome!
