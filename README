This project is an implementation of the paper:
"Traffic Morphing: An efficient defense against statistical traffic analysis"
by Charles Wright, Scott Coull, and Fabian Monrose.

It's written in Python and it uses GLPK to solve Linear Programming
problems.

In the topdir you can find:

* morpheus.py: You pass it a source and a target probability
    distribution of packet lengths and it writes a morphing matrix in
    sparse matrix COO format to a given output file.
    You can then use those morphing matrices to your heart's content.
* dream.py: A small library that understands what a morphing matrix
    is. You pass it a morphing matrix and then it can answer questions
    like: "What possible shapes can a packet of 420 bytes take for
    this morphing matrix?" or "Give me a target packet length for a
    packet of 12 bytes right now."
* data/: The data/ directory contains some potentially useful
    packet length probability distributions.
* ACKNOWLEDGMENTS: A kind and cheerful text file that thanks people
    who helped this project.
* README: Hmmmm...
