The packet length probability distributions in data/ were created
after analysis of traffic traces provided by CAIDA [1].
The traffic traces were captured by monitoring an Equinix datacenter
in Chicago, IL [2].

Specifically, the packet length probability distributions would not
exist without the help of Zack Weinberg, Vinod Yegneswaran, Paul Hick
and kc claffy.
